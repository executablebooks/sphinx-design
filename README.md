A sphinx extension for designing beautiful, view size responsive web components.

## Usage

Simply pip install `sphinx-design` and add the extension to your `conf.py`:

```python
extensions = ["sphinx_design"]
```

## Comparison to sphinx-panels

This package is an iteration on sphinx-panels and intends to replace it.

- Replaces `panel` directive with top-level `grid` + children `grid-item-card`
  - less "bespoke" syntax
  - `grid-item` can be used when no card is needed
  - `card` can be used independently of grids
- tabs changed:
  - top-level `tab-set`
  - `tabbed` -> `tab-item`
  - include `:sync:` option to synchronize tab selection across sets
- Minimises direct use of CSS classes (encourage to not use them)
  - More declarative, easy to understand options, easier to validate
  - Easier to work with non-HTML outputs
  - Easier to improve/refactor
- Updated Bootstrap CSS v4 -> v5
  - top-level grid can define both column numbers and gutter sizes
- All CSS classes are prefixed with `sd-` (no clash with other theme/extension CSS)
- All colors use CSS variables (customisable)

## TODO

- note design goal; to be flexible, but limit the amount of directive nesting required.
  This factors in to
  - card header/footer syntax? (don't really want to have to use separate directives for these, hence `^^^`/`+++` syntax)
  - auto-wrap `grid-item` and `tab-item`, if not already inside `grid` or `tab-set`?

grids items cannot contain headers; is this in anyway possible with docutils structure?

naming of directives/roles: standard prefix?

why are cards setup with "word-wrap: break-word;"?

Use autoprefixer when compiling SASS (see <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/#supported-browsers>)
