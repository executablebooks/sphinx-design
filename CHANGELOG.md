# Change Log

## Unreleased

- ✨ NEW: Card headers and footers now have dedicated, parser-portable
  `card-header` / `card-footer` directives (plus inline `:header:` / `:footer:`
  options for one-liners), which are hoisted into their slots. The whole card
  body is parsed in a single pass, so error messages point at the right line.
  The legacy `^^^` / `+++` separators — which scan the card's raw source lines
  — remain on by default behind the new `sd_card_legacy_separators` option,
  emitting a suppressible `design.card_legacy` deprecation warning once per
  document; both syntaxes produce identical doctrees. Note that the single-parse
  robustness — correct line numbers, and a stray `^^^` / `+++` (e.g. inside a
  code block) no longer mis-splitting the card — is only fully realized once the
  legacy separators are disabled with `sd_card_legacy_separators = False`
  (planned to become the default at 1.0). One behaviour change: an *empty*
  `card-header` / `card-footer` directive now errors (`Content block expected`),
  where an empty legacy chunk produced an empty slot. See the cards
  documentation for the mechanical migration ({pr}`PRNUM`)
- ♻️ REFACTOR: The private `CardDirective._create_component` helper is renamed
  to `_create_slot`; a back-compatible alias is kept for one release for
  downstream extensions that call it ({pr}`PRNUM`)
- ♻️ IMPROVE: Replace the Sass/Node build with a dependency-free Python CSS
  generator (`tools/generate_css.py` driven by `style/design.toml` and
  hand-authored `style/*.css`); `package.json` is gone. The compiled
  `sphinx-design.min.css` is a rule-set no-op apart from two deliberate
  changes. Hover/focus shades now use runtime `color-mix()` (behind a static
  fallback), so overriding a `--sd-color-*` variable now flows through to its
  `-highlight` shade instead of the shade being frozen at build time. Also
  purges ~150 dead vendor prefixes (IE `-ms-flex*`, and `-moz-`/`-webkit-`
  animation, box-sizing and user-select duplicates) that no supported browser
  needs. The migration was verified rule-for-rule *and* cascade-order-faithful
  against the previous stylesheet, and the new build fails loudly on
  unregistered style files, malformed token data, or a stale/unparsable
  artifact — see the new "Design: the CSS pipeline" documentation page
  ({pr}`290`)
- 📚 DOCS: Document the browser support policy as
  [Baseline Widely Available](https://web.dev/baseline) (evergreen
  Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari, no Internet Explorer), replacing the stale 2021
  Bootstrap browserslist mirror ({pr}`290`)
- 🔧 MAINTAIN: CI now compiles the documentation's LaTeX output to PDF
  (exercising the `sd_fontawesome_latex="fontawesome5"` icon path, which the
  docs now use), and the fa-build hint recommends `"fontawesome5"` over the
  legacy FontAwesome 4 package ({pr}`289`)
- ✨ NEW: `sd_fontawesome_version` makes icon role names version-agnostic:
  any spelling (`fas`, `fa-solid`, ...) can emit the FontAwesome `"4"`, `"5"`
  or `"6"` class scheme, so upgrading FontAwesome is a one-line `conf.py`
  change; the default `"as-named"` keeps emitting the role name verbatim
  ({pr}`288`, {issue}`174`)
- ✨ NEW: Badge roles accept a trailing `` ; tooltip `` suffix, rendered as a
  native HTML `title` tooltip on all `bdg-*` families; for the link/ref badges
  the suffix applies only after the explicit `text <target>` form (semicolons
  are valid in URLs and reference targets), and a literal `;` in badge text is
  escaped as `` \; `` ({pr}`286`, {issue}`81`)
- ✨ NEW: FontAwesome v6 roles (`fa-solid`/`fa-brands`/`fa-regular`) and
  declarative CSS loading via the new `sd_fontawesome_source` /
  `sd_fontawesome_cdn_url` options (the supported path for FontAwesome Pro
  kits) ({pr}`285`, {issue}`174`)
- 👌 IMPROVE: `sd_fontawesome_latex` now also accepts `"fontawesome5"` (adding
  `fontawesome5.sty` and emitting `\faIcon{...}`), resolving package clashes
  with themes that load `fontawesome5`; `True`/`False` keep working unchanged
  ({pr}`285`, {issue}`242`)
- 🐛 FIX: Synced tabs stay in sync when activated by click-and-drag or keyboard,
  by syncing on the radio input's `change` event rather than a label click
  ({pr}`284`, {issue}`46`)
- ✨ NEW: A URL fragment that targets a tab (e.g. `page.html#tab-name`), or an
  element inside a tab panel, now opens that tab (both on load and on
  `hashchange`) ({pr}`284`, {issue}`239`)
- 👌 IMPROVE: Tab selections now persist across browsing sessions, via
  `localStorage` instead of `sessionStorage` (a behaviour change), and the
  storage key prefix is configurable with the new `sd_tabs_storage_prefix`
  option (set it to an empty string to disable persistence) ({pr}`284`,
  {issue}`103`)
- 👌 IMPROVE: Restore keyboard focus rings on tab labels, dropdown summaries,
  buttons and stretched-link cards, using `:focus-visible` so they are visible
  for keyboard users but not shown on mouse click, thanks to {user}`gabalafou`
  in {pr}`230` (carried in {pr}`283`)
- 👌 IMPROVE: Each tab label now carries an `aria-controls` attribute
  referencing its content panel's id, establishing the programmatic
  relationship in the accessibility tree (note: this is not a full WAI-ARIA
  tabs pattern; assistive-technology support for `aria-controls` varies)
  ({pr}`283`, {issue}`30`)
- 🐛 FIX: `card`/`grid-item-card` `:link:` no longer strips whitespace from reference targets (and lowercases them for `link-type: ref`, matching the `:ref:` role), completing the fix for {issue}`110` ({pr}`282`)
- 🐛 FIX: `button-ref` no longer strips whitespace from reference targets, so
  multi-word labels (e.g. from `autosectionlabel`) resolve correctly
  ({pr}`281`, {issue}`110`)
- 🐛 FIX: `button-ref` now renders rich/nested inline content (emphasis, icons,
  etc.) identically to `button-link`, instead of flattening it to plain text
  during cross-reference resolution ({pr}`281`, {issue}`228`)
- 🐛 FIX: Inline icon roles no longer leak SVG markup into toctree labels and the search index ({pr}`279`, {issue}`99`)
- 🐛 FIX: `article-info` octicons regain their `sd-pr-2` spacing class (previously silently dropped by the HTML writer) ({pr}`279`)
- 🐛 FIX: Paragraphs inside dropdowns no longer have user classes overwritten by `sd-card-text`, and card/dropdown body styling is applied only to direct child paragraphs, not nested content ({pr}`278`, {issue}`40`)
- ✨ NEW: `sphinx_design.testing` module with the `normalize_doctree_xml` helper, for downstream extensions' doctree regression tests ({pr}`277`, {issue}`260`)
- ♻️ IMPROVE: Static assets (CSS/JS) are now served via Sphinx's standard
  `html_static_path` mechanism, rather than being written directly into the
  build output; non-HTML builds no longer gain a spurious
  `_sphinx_design_static` directory ({pr}`276`, {issue}`200`, {issue}`235`).
  A stale `_sphinx_design_static` directory left in an existing HTML build
  directory by previous versions is unused and can safely be deleted.
- ⬆️ UPGRADE: Sphinx `>=7.2` is now required ({pr}`276`)
- 🗑️ REMOVE: The private `sphinx_design._compat.findall` helper has been
  removed (docutils `Element.findall` is guaranteed by the Sphinx floor);
  any code importing it should call `node.findall(...)` directly ({pr}`276`)
- 🐛 FIX: buttons are no longer destroyed by gettext translation:
  translated `button-link`/`button-ref` keep their styling and links
  (gettext now targets only the button text), thanks to {user}`sneakers-the-rat`
  in {pr}`264` ({issue}`96`, {issue}`44`, {issue}`263`)

## 0.6.0 - 2024-05-23

### Dependencies

* ⬆️ Python v3.9-3.12 by {user}`chrisjsewell` in {pr}`186`
* ⬆️ Octicon icons to v19.8.0 by {user}`ffvpor` in {pr}`171`

### New

#### ✨ Create custom directives

You can use the `sd_custom_directives` configuration option in your `conf.py` to add custom directives, with default option values:

```python
sd_custom_directives = {
  "dropdown-syntax": {
    "inherit": "dropdown",
    "argument": "Syntax",
    "options": {
      "color": "primary",
      "icon": "code",
    },
  }
}
```

The key is the new directive name to add, and the value is a dictionary with the following keys:

- `inherit`: The directive to inherit from (e.g. `dropdown`)
- `argument`: The default argument (optional, only for directives that take a single argument)
- `options`: A dictionary of default options for the directive (optional)

by {user}`chrisjsewell` in {pr}`194`

#### ✨ sync tabs by URL query parameters

Synchronised tabs can now be selected by adding a query parameter to the URL, for that sync-group, such as `?code=python` for

```restructuredtext
.. tab-set-code::

    .. literalinclude:: snippet.py
        :language: python

    .. literalinclude:: snippet.js
        :language: javascript
```

The last selected tab key, per group, is also persisted to `SessionStorage`

by {user}`mikemckiernan` and {user}`chrisjsewell` in {pr}`196`

### Improve

* 👌 Use reference name by default for internal link cards by {user}`gabalafou` in {pr}`183`
* 👌 Improve specificity of JS function name by {user}`danirus` in {pr}`153`
* 👌 Remove duplicate CSS hashing for sphinx >= 7.1 by {user}`chrisjsewell` in {pr}`193`

#### 👌 Improve `dropdown` title bar

There are three visible changes:

1. The "default" behaviour of the right chevron is to go from right-facing (closed) to down-facing (open), instead of down-facing (closed) to up-facing (open). There is also a rotate transition on opening/closing.
The old default behaviour can be retained by using the new `:chevron: down-up` directive option.
2. The prefix icon (optional), title text, and chevron state icon are now all better aligned
3. The top/bottom padding is now 0.5em instead of 1em

The PR also introduces three new CSS variables to control font sizes of the dropdown:

```css
--sd-fontsize-tabs-label: 1rem;
--sd-fontsize-dropdown-title: 1rem;
--sd-fontweight-dropdown-title: 700;
```

Internally, the HTML / CSS is changed, such that the title is now an `inline-flex` box, with three columns arranged with `justify-content: space-between`:

| icon (optional) | text (`flex-grow: 1`) | state chevron |
| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
|                |                      |                |

Also, the state chevron was previously two distinct SVGs (with one hidden), but now is one that get rotated on open/close.
