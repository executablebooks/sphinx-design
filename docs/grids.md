# Grids

## Introduction

Grids are based on a 12 column system, which can adapt to the size of the viewing screen.

A `grid` directive can be set with the number of default columns (1 to 12);
either a single number for all screen sizes, or four numbers for extra-small (<576px), small (768px), medium (992px) and large screens (>1200px),
then child `grid-item` directives should be set for each item.

Try re-sizing the screen to see the number of columns change:

::::{grid} 1 2 3 4
:outline:

:::{grid-item}
A
:::
:::{grid-item}
B
:::
:::{grid-item}
C
:::
:::{grid-item}
D
:::
::::

`````{dropdown} Syntax
:icon: code
:color: primary

````{tab-set-code}
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/myst/grid-basic.txt
:language: markdown
```
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/rst/grid-basic.txt
:language: rst
```
````
`````

You can also use the `auto` value for the column width(s), to size columns based on the natural width of their content.

::::{grid} auto

:::{grid-item}
:outline:
:padding: 2

short text content
:::
:::{grid-item}
:outline:
:padding: 2

some longer text content
:::
:::{grid-item}
:outline:
:padding: 2

short text content
:::
::::

## Placing a card in a grid

The `grid-item-card` directive is a short-hand for placing a card content container inside a grid item (see [Cards](./cards.md)). Most of the `card` directive's options can be used also here:

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item-card} Title 1
A
:::
:::{grid-item-card} Title 2
B
:::
::::

`````{dropdown} Syntax
:icon: code
:color: primary

````{tab-set-code}
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/myst/grid-card.txt
:language: markdown
```
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/rst/grid-card.txt
:language: rst
```
````
`````

## Controlling spacing between items

You can set the spacing between grid items with the `gutter` option.
Like for grid columns, you can either provide a single number or four for small, medium and large and extra-large screens.

::::{grid} 2
:gutter: 1

:::{grid-item-card}
A
:::
:::{grid-item-card}
B
:::
::::

::::{grid} 2
:gutter: 3 3 4 5

:::{grid-item-card}
A
:::
:::{grid-item-card}
B
:::
::::

`````{dropdown} Syntax
:icon: code
:color: primary

````{tab-set-code}
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/myst/grid-gutter.txt
:language: markdown
```
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/rst/grid-gutter.txt
:language: rst
```
````
`````

## Item level column width

You can override the number of columns a single item takes up by using the `columns` option of the `grid-item` directive.
Given the total columns are 12, this means 12 would indicate a single item takes up the entire grid row, or 6 half.
Alternatively, use `auto` to automatically decide how many columns to use based on the item content.
Like for grid columns, you can either provide a single number or four for small, medium and large and extra-large screens.

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: auto

A
:::
:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: 12 6 6 6

B
:::
:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: 12

C
:::
::::

`````{dropdown} Syntax
:icon: code
:color: primary

````{tab-set-code}
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/myst/grid-card-columns.txt
:language: markdown
```
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/rst/grid-card-columns.txt
:language: rst
```
````
`````

## Reversing the item order

Use the `grid` directive's `reverse` option to reverse the order of the items.
This can be useful if you want an item to be on the right side on large screens, but at the top on small screens.

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
:reverse:

:::{grid-item}
```{image} ./images/ebp-logo.png
:width: 200px
:class: sd-m-auto
```
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Some text
:::

::::

## Nesting grids

Grids can be nested in other grids to create complex, adaptive layouts:

::::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
:gutter: 1

:::::{grid-item}

::::{grid} 1 1 1 1
:gutter: 1

:::{grid-item-card} Item 1.1

Multi-line

content

:::

:::{grid-item-card} Item 1.2

Content

:::

::::

:::::

:::::{grid-item}

::::{grid} 1 1 1 1
:gutter: 1

:::{grid-item-card} Item 2.1

Content

:::

:::{grid-item-card} Item 2.2

Content

:::

:::{grid-item-card} Item 2.3

Content

:::

::::

:::::

::::::

`````{dropdown} Syntax
:icon: code
:color: primary

````{tab-set-code}
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/myst/grid-nested.txt

```
```{literalinclude} ./snippets/rst/grid-nested.txt
