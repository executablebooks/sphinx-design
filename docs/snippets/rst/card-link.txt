Clickable cards
...............

Using the ``link`` and ``link-type`` options, you can turn an entire card into a clickable link. Try hovering over then clicking on the cards below:

.. card:: Clickable Card (external)
    :link: https://example.com
    :link-alt: example.com

    The entire card can be clicked to navigate to https://example.com.

    For **external** link cards, if you do not provide ``link-alt``, the URL will be used as the text of the link. Using URLs as link text makes it harder for disabled people and for search engines to digest your web page, so it's best to provide link text via the ``link-alt`` option.

.. card:: Clickable Card (internal)
    :link: cards-clickable
    :link-type: ref

    The entire card can be clicked to navigate to the ``cards-clickable`` reference target.

    For **internal** link cards, it's unnecessary to provide ``link-alt``. The name of the section that you are referencing will be used as the link's accessible name. For example, this card references ``cards-clickable``, so the link title will be "Clickable cards" (same as the section heading). If you wish to use a different title for the link, you can provide ``link-alt`` and it will take precedence.

Note: you cannot add additional links to the clickable card, neither in the card title nor in the card body. The entire card becomes a single link to the destination you specify, which overrides any other links inside the card.
